# rekordbox_project

Idea of a program created for Rekordbox users (and not only) to facilitate the choosing of the next song in a DJ set. It currently looks at BPM and Key of the currently playing song (or looks at a user specified deck and gathers relevant song info from there), and based on this information, it searches through local library of songs and creates a folder with suggested songs in which the DJ might mix into.

It uses relevant concepts like the Camelot wheel for mixing in key and BPM of next song at a difference of maximum 20% to ease the mixing without creating too much of a transition difficulty.

Best used into a B2B set or simply in a mixing session where the songs for the set are not chosen in advance.
