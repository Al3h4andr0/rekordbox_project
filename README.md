# rekordbox_project

Developed a real-time plugin for Rekordbox (DJ performance software) that extracts the currently playing track (title, BPM, key) using OCR techniques, then analyzes a local music library to generate and export harmonic song recommendations based on Camelot key compatibility and tempo range. Output is formatted in Rekordbox XML for live import without restarting the software. The solution integrates hotkey activation, deck selection, and future plans include GUI and tray-based interaction.
